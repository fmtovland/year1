2. Write a program that reads a sentence from the keyboard and uses separate functions
to do the following:

contains at least 1 occurrence of this word).
b) Calculates the number of characters in the sentence.
c) Appends the sentence to the end of the following string: “My sentence is : “
3. Write a program that allows a user to input two words. Compare these words to see if
they are the same. Display appropriate messages whether or not the two words are the
same.

the following:
a) Concatenate the first word entered to the end of the string: "First word entered
