# week 5

This is the code I wrote in week 5 of studying in DIT. The files are as follows


isvowel.c will Input a character and decide if it is a vowel.
odd-even.c will check whether a number is odd or even.
married.c is an if statment (not provided) converted to a switch statment.
isfactor.c will read in two numbers and check if the first is evenly divisable by the second.
triangle.c will read in two numbers and decide if they could be the lengths of the sides of a triangle
num2word.c will read in any number between one and 10 and print it as a word. eg. "5" would be "five"
num2day.c will read in a number between one and seven and display a day of the week.
