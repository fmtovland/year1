#Lab test 1

The first time I was ever required to write an entire program in one hour: The first time I had to make a program under pressure

#labtest1.py

So I just found out you need python or C++ or java for a google internship that google is running at time of writing. so to teach myself python, I redid this assignment in python. every feature besides ensuring it is a 4 digit leap year is present in the python version.
