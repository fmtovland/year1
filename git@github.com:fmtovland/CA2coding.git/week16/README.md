#functions part 3
1. Pass by Reference. Write a program that uses 2 functions (1 function to calculate the
area of a Square, another function to calculate the area of a Circle). Declare a variable
in your main for the length of a side of the Square and another variable for the Radius
of the Circle. Ask the user to enter these values. Using Pass by Reference, pass these
as parameters to the separate functions, calculate the areas of the Square and Circle in
their separate function, and display the results in your main(). Remember, you must
use Pass by Reference. Do not forget to declare 2 prototypes for your 2 functions.

2. Passing 1-D Array. Write a program that uses a function to find the highest number in
an array containing 5 numbers. In the main(), you must ask the user to enter 5
numbers and store these in the array. Pass the array to a function and your function
must find the highest number. Return this number to your main() and display it.

3. Passing 1-D Array. Write a program that uses a function to calculate the average of 5
numbers in an array. In the main(), you must ask the user to enter 5 numbers and store
these in the array. Pass the array to a function and calculate the average of these 5
numbers. Return the average to your main() and display this.

4. Passing 1-D Array. Make a copy of Q2 above but this time, use your function to
change the contents of the array, i.e. multiply each number in the array by 2. When
your function has finished and your program continues in your main(), print the
contents of your array in your main() and see if the changes made to the contents of
the array in your function can be seen. If not, why?

5. Write a program that passes an array to a function containing 5 numbers and checks
each number if it is even or odd. Use your function to display each number and
whether it is even or odd. Calculate the total number of even numbers and return this
number to your main() and display it.
