#oddreven.c requirements
Returning a value from a function. Write a program that uses a function to check if a
number is even or odd. Your main() should allow the user to enter any number and
this should be passed to your function. Your function should check if the number is
even or odd and return a 1 if even or a 0 if odd. Your main() should then indicate the
result.

#mean.c requirements
Returning a value from a function. Write a program that uses a function to calculate
the average of 3 numbers. Your main() should ask the user to enter these 3 numbers
and they should be passed to the function as parameters. Your function should
calculate the average and return this value back to the main(). Your main() should
then display this average value.

#highest.c requirements
Returning a value from a function. Write a program that uses a function to check for
the highest value of 3 numbers. You should enter the 3 numbers using main() and
these should be passed to your function. Your function should find the highest of
these numbers and return it back to main(). Your main() should then display this
highest number

#mode.c requirements
Returning a value from a function. Write a program that uses a function to calculate
the most commonly used character from a number of 3 characters entered by a user.
Your main() should read the 3 characters and these should be passed to your function.
Your function should calculate the most common character of the 3 (assume the user
enters more than one occurrence of any character). This character should then be
returned to the main(). Your main() should then display this character with an
appropriate message

#byvalue.c requirements
Write a program to demonstrate the use of Pass by Value with a
function. Begin by creating an integer variable in your main() and initialise it to 1.
Print this value here. Next, call your function and pass this variable as a parameter to
the function. Increment the parameter in your function by 2 and print this value. Your
function should end here and control passed back to your main(). Print the value of
the variable in your main() again and see if it has changed value. Did the function
increment the variable in your main()?

#byref.c requirements
Write a program similar to Q5 but this time use Pass by Reference
to modify the integer variable declared in main().
